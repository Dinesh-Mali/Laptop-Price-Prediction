# Laptop-Price-Prediction
This App predicts the price of the laptop using ML models.

# Introduction
Predict the Price of the Laptop based on common features like Memory, processor and many more attributes.

# Project Flow

1) Load the data into dataframe.

2) Perform data preprocessing like handling missing values, feature creation, etc.

3) Perform exploratory data analysis and get valuable insights from the data.

4) Model building - selecting the best algorithm for prediction.

5) Hyper-parameter Tuning, setting the right parameters for the algorithms.

6) Serving the model into Pickle and integrate it UI.

7) Deploy the application on Heroku Cloud Platform.
